# IoT and Communication Solution üì°üöÄ

This project integrates hardware and software components to create a versatile image classification system. Upon activation, triggered by a microswitch, a camera module captures images and saves them to an SD card. A deep learning model deployed on the microcontroller retrieves these images, conducts classification, and transmits the results to the receiver via a transmitter. Once received, the classification results are updated in a Firebase cloud database. 

## Getting Started üèÅ
### Prerequisites
Clone the repo: 
```
https://github.com/FYP-19/IoT-and-Communication.git
```
Go to directory and install necessary liberies including:
```
pip install RPi.GPIO
```
```
pip install Pillow
```
```
pip install tflite_runtime
```
* Update the model path in file ``Executor.py``.
* Update the firestore database credential file path in ``DB_manager.py``.  

## System Architecture Diagrams
 Provide an overall architectural diagram illustrating how the various components of the system interact with each other.
